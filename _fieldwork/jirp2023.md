The Juneau Icefield Research Program (JIRP) is a unique life experience where students can learn from nature in nature. We have traversed the Juneau Icefield, starting in Juneau, going up to Atlin, following the invisible trails of students and scientists of the past 75 years. The program builds upon the motto "Nature, Books, and Action", and gives students a cross-discplinary entry to glaciology. 

## Learnings
We learn from our field staff how to survive, navigate, and appreciate the ice. We learn from our faculty members to understand, question, and research glaciers. We learn from our medics how to take care of each other. We learn from our artists how to express, capture, and contemplate the ice. And we learn from each other, every moment, how to listen, how to care, and how to love. The icefield is like a different world, a haven for your soul. On the icefield you can meet yourself - your true self, and realize that the person you want to be is already there - within you.

## The Land
The Juneau Icefield Research Program takes place on the lands of the Tlingit (Lingit Ani), Carcross/Tagish First Nation, Taku River Tlingit, Tesling Tlingit, and Denendeh people. Their past guidance plays a huge role in the history of this program. Current students have been learning from their stories, and will hopefully continue to do so and extend their perspective on knowledge systems beyond science. JIRP wants to build stronger connections to all native communities, and strives to support the Tlingit community in building a program for their people - and learn together from nature.
