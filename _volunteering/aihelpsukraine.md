I personally believe that the best way the AI community can support Ukraine right now, is by providing financial support. This is why we are organizing the “AI Helps Ukraine - Charity Conference”, a conference that raises money to support Ukraine with medical and humanitarian aid. Some of the most outstanding AI researchers, including Yoshua Bengio, Regina Barzilay, Max Welling, Timnit Gebru and Anna Goldenberg are supporting our cause as speakers.

One detrimental aspect of the war has been its effect on medical supplies. My friends at Mila learned about this disastrous situation firsthand from their friends and families in Ukraine. I know from personal experience how much one’s life can depend on the right medical supply and I wish that everyone in Ukraine has access to this.

A big part of the money will be used to buy medication and medical gear urgently needed to treat cancer patients. We collaborate with UAMS to deliver those to local hospitals and the National Cancer Institute of Ukraine.

The conference is free of charge because we believe that knowledge about AI For Good topics should be accessible to anyone. Everyone is welcome to the conference and we encourage everyone to give what they can. We especially built on the support of tech and pharma companies to reach our goal. Let’s stand up for Ukraine - together as a tech community.
