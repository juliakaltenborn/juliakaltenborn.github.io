We try to make a dialogue between all kinds of people possible: First we learn together with experts about a certain topic, then we share our perspectives and subsequently we act effectively and united on concrete problems that were found during our dialogue. That way we would like to depolarize our debate culture.

In 2022, we put forward [Our Dialogue About AI](https://unserdialog.org/en/unser-dialog/unser-dialog-about-artificial-intelligence/) - a series where the general public can learn about AI and become empowered: “Your perspective on AI matters!”. We would like this to become the starting point for a citizen forum on AI since our vision is that the general public will be actively included into AI decision making in the years to come.

In 2022, we were the first non-profit social startup to receive the Mila Startup status. We are very grateful for the funding and the support we receive by Mila! I am glad to see how Mila supports me in giving something back to our society this way.

In 2024, Unser Dialog is offering a series on mental health and psychological well-being and has entered several co-operations.
