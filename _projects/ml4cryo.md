Together with other PhD students active in the Machine Learning for Cryospheric Sciences domain, we are building up our young, interdisciplinary community. We want to establish a network that people can join to collaborate with and learn from each other.

This involves the following endevours:

- **Centralize internal communication:** [Slack Space](https://tinyurl.com/join-slack-ml4cryo) and [Newsletter](https://tinyurl.com/join-mail-ml4cryo)
- **Structure the available knowledge and identify challenges:** Review Paper
- **Transfering and sharing knowledge:** Workshops and [Conference Sessions](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/session/52609)
- **Entry point for new researchers:** [Website](https://ml4cryo.github.io/)

We are still at the very beginning. If you are interested in joining, feel free to reach out to us.

People currently involved: [Andrew McDonald](https://ampersandmcd.com/), [Kim Bente](https://kimbente.com/), [David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/), and [Chris Derksen](https://cca-reports.ca/experts/chris-derksen/).
