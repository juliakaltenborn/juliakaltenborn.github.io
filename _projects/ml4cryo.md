Together with other PhD students active in the Machine Learning for Cryospheric Sciences domain, I am striving build up our young community. We want to centralize and bundle our communication and knowledge to enhance our impact.

This involves the following endevours:

- **Centralize internal communication:** Slack Space / Mailing List 
- **Structure the available knowledge and identify challenges:** Review Paper
- **Transfering and sharing knowledge:** Workshops
- **Entry point for new researchers:** Website / Collection of essential ressources

We are still at the very beginning. If you are interested in joining, feel free to reach out to us.

People currently involved: [Andrew McDonald](https://ampersandmcd.com/), [Kim Bente](https://kimbente.com/), and [Facu Sapienza](https://facusapienza.org/)
