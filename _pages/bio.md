## Short version

Julia Kaltenborn is a PhD student at McGill University and the Mila-Quebec AI Institute under the supervision of Prof. David Rolnick. Her research focuses on machine learning for climate and cryospheric sciences. She engages in hands-on field work to understand the needs of the cryo-community better and create more impactful ML tools. Put differently, she is developing ML models with the approach "learning from nature in nature".

## Standard version

Julia Kaltenborn is a PhD student at McGill University and the Mila-Quebec AI Institute. Her research is two-fold: She explores machine learning for climate model emulation, and cryospheric sciences. She focuses on creating ML resources that can be used cross-disciplinary, such as ClimateSet, and developing ML models that are actively used in the field, e.g., by MOSAiC, the largest polar expedition in history. Julia co-founded the NGO Unser Dialog, co-organized AI Helps Ukraine, and was a local Greenpeace leader in her youth. She has been a fellow of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation, received the Mitacs Globalink Research Fellowship, and was a DeepMind scholar. Last but not least, Julia was a member of the Juneau Icefield Research Expedition 2023 and has traversed the Juneau Icefield.
