I am a **PhD Student** at McGill University and Mila - Quebec AI Institute under the academic advise of Prof. David Rolnick.

I have fast-tracked from my Computer Science MSc at McGill in September 2023. I obtained a BSc in Cognitive Science at the Osnabrück University in Germany.

I did internships at the SLF and at Caltech and the INRS and studied in Tokyo (Chuo Daigaku) for one semester.

I have been a fellow of ....

Beyond research, I have been engaged in Climate Action for most of my life, and co-founded the NGO Unser Dialog. Last but not least, I am proud participant of the Juneau Icefield Research Expedition and have traversed the icefield in summer 2023.

At Mila, I research **machine learning methods for accelerating scientific discoveries to tackle the climate crisis**. Currently, my focus is on developing generative methods, such as GFlowNets, and active learning algorithms for materials and drug discovery. In particular, I am working on multi-fidelity active learning methods, crystal structure generation, electrocatalyst design or molecular conformation sampling. I am also leading the development of [a GFlowNet python library](https://github.com/alexhernandezgarcia/gflownet), together with many collaborators. With [Victor Schmidt](https://vict0rs.ch/), [Sasha Luccioni](https://www.sashaluccioni.com/) and larger wonderful team, I also helped create [ThisClimateDoesNotExist.com](https://thisclimatedoesnotexist.com/), a website to help us visualise the impacts of climate change in our own backyard.


#### My Research Vision
Besides my research, I am a strong proponent of open science in the broadest sense, and I try to contribute to it with my actions and by getting involved in discussions about how to make science more inclusive, equitable, open, reproducible, transparent and environmentally conscious. Recently, I helped co-organise a [workshop on pre-registration in machine learning](https://preregister.science/) at NeurIPS 2021. At Mila, I am a Lab Representative and a member of the Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee.
