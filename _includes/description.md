I am a **PhD Student** at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/) under the academic advise of [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/). I fast-tracked from McGill's MSc Computer Science program and hold a BSc in Cognitive Science by the [Osnabrück University](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/startseite.html). During my BSc I studied abroad in Japan at [中央大学](https://www.chuo-u.ac.jp/english/), and back in Germany taught students old-fashioned AI - with Prolog. Later on, I forecasted river levels at the [INRS](https://inrs.ca/en/), classified snowpacks for [MOSAiC](https://mosaic-expedition.org/) (the largest polar expedition in history) at the [SLF](https://www.slf.ch/en/), and tracked cyclones at the [Climate Modeling Alliance](https://clima.caltech.edu/) at Caltech.

My research focuses on:

- **Machine Learning for Climate Modeling**
- **Machine Learning for Cryospheric Sciences**

I have been a fellow of the [German Academic Scholarship Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studienstiftung) throughout my studies, received the [Mitacs Globalink Research Fellowship](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-graduate-fellowship-students-postdocs/), and was a [DeepMind scholar](https://deepmind.google/about/education/).

Beyond research, I have been engaged in climate action for most of my life, and co-founded the NGO [Unser Dialog](https://unserdialog.org/). Last but not least, I am a proud participant of the [Juneau Icefield Research Expedition](https://juneauicefield.org/) and have traversed the icefield in 2023.


#### Current Research
Currently, I am a visiting PhD student at the [Snow- and Avalanche Research Institute](https://www.slf.ch/en/) in Davos, Switzerland, under the supervision of Tiziano Di Pietro and [Dr. Martin Schneebeli](https://www.slf.ch/de/mitarbeitende/schneebm/). I am involved in the data campaign planning, field work and ML development for **snowpack stability prediction**.

I also continue to work on **ClimateSet** ([A Large-Scale Climate Model Dataset for ML](https://climateset.github.io/)) and our endeavor to super-emulate CMIP6. Moreover, I am putting a team together for reviewing ML in Cryospheric sciences, and building a connected **ML4Cryo** community.
